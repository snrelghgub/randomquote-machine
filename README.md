# Random Quote Machine

https://pedantic-wescoff-370b86.netlify.com/

## Project Description
My random quote machine extracts quotes as well as their relevant author's name from an online available Gist. Both container & presentational components are used with the React framework to create & handle the main functionality of the app which allows for randomly selected & displayed quotes each time the user each time the user requests a new one. By tactfully passing a text query parameter, it is also possible for a user to easily share a displayed quote if he/she wishes to do so.Bootstrap's card component system as well as one of its utilities, flex, is used to also present the layout of the quote machine now responsive & compatible on most modern desktop & mobile/tablet devices.
