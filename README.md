# Random Quote Machine

https://randomquote-machine.netlify.com/

## Project Description
My random quote machine extracts & displays quotes as well as their relevant author's name from an online available Gist. Both container & presentational components are used with the React framework to create & handle the main functionality of the app which is to initialise & display at least one quote at first load & to also allow for a randomly selected & displayed quote each time the user requests a new one. A text query parameter is passed to a twitter-intent URL to also make it possible for a user to share a currently displayed quote via a clickable twitter icon. Bootstrap's card component system as well as one of its utilities, flex, is also used to classify the machine's layout & provide full responsiveness & compatibility on most modern desktop & mobile/tablet devices available today.
